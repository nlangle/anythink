              The Witch Tree on Riverdale road is notorious for being one of the scariest places to drive by on Riverdale. Back in the early colonization of the United States, settlers moved their way into Colorado a few hundred set up in the areas which are now known as Brighton and Thornton. A few also placed themselves into the area which bridges Brighton and Thornton together, and there began the creation of Riverdale. An old Widow lived up on one of the hills above Riverdale, around October maybe even November small children from ages three to thirteen began to go missing. The villagers became suspicious and looked towards the old Widow for answers.
            </p>
            <p>
              About thirteen adults from each village made their way up the hill to the Widow’s home. Knocking on the door three times they spread out to look for the Widow. Riverdale was once surrounded by thick forest and most of the villagers got “lost”. A group of three found the Widow, but not only the widow but children too. The Widow was weeping over the bodies and the rest of the children were tied to a tree. The tree was near a stream in which the Widow had used to drown the small children, there was a small cabin which held axes and pitch forks. No one knows what those were used to do. The remaining villagers untied the children and ran back.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two weeks later with a band of 26 villagers made there way back up to the Widow’s house, finding her and pinning her down with her hands behind her back. They took her to the tree, by the stream, near the cabin. They placed a noose around her neck, without asking why her crimes were done they accused her of witchcraft and hung her. Before the rope was pulled she said these words “I’ll be back.”
              With her necked snapped the villagers celebrated and left her body hanging.
            </p>
            <p>
              They never took her body down, her body went through the stages of decomposition and all that was left was her spleen and skull, which fell to the roots. As the tree grew larger the roots covered her bones growing over them, crushing them into the dirt.
            </p>
            <p>
              They say, if you find the Witch Tree at night you can hear her final words. But be warned she might drag you to the stream or maybe hang you too. Tell me, is this local urban legend, or did it happen?
