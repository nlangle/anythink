                Developing a project or program for the Solar in Your Community Challenge requires careful consideration and planning. This resource page is designed to help guide and inform contestants of all levels of expertise launch their project or program successfully. These resources provide detailed overviews of issues like project development, customer acquisition, financing, permitting and interconnection, system design, and low and moderate income participation. We encourage contestants to familiarize themselves with these resources, and use them in conjunction with their Challenge coaches and other technical assistance.

              <h2>Solar Curriculum</h2>
              <p>
                Our solar curriculum launched September 29th, 2017. We're holding interactive classes on LMI policy, project design, customer acquisition, solar finance, and more almost every Friday. Check out the curriculum page and view upcoming lectures <a href="solar-curriculum.html">here</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                We've also compiled a collection of short videos of solar experts talking about challenges and opportunities that might be of interest to challenge teams. The videos are 1 to 7 minutes long, and cover topics including 'Using LIHEAP funds for solar', 'how to brand your project and get media attention', and 'USDA grants and resources for solar'. Check out the solar shorts <a href="solar-shorts.html">here</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                On October 11th we held a Solar in Your Community Challenge Workshop at the ASES Solar Conference in Denver, Colorado. Attendees heard success stories from teams, as well as several lectures on solar financing. Check out powerpoints from those talks <a href="ases.html">here</a>.

              <p>
                The following list of resources is designed to help Solar in Your Community Challenge project participants to understand the basics of community solar, different community solar business models, potential state and local policies that can impact a project, as well as the potential financial impacts of a project. Challenge participants should carefully consider these issues when planning and developing the goals for their project, and consider these resources a “starting point” for their planning process.

              <p>
                Designing a shared solar program and recruiting offtakers is one of the most important steps of the project development process. Project developers who are new to shared solar should consider treating customer acquisition and program design in tandem, that is, work to design the program in a way that is appealing to customers, and is well aligned to their project goals. The following resources include potential model rules for community solar, potential ways to design a program that is aligned with customer demand, and ways to egage your community about the benefits of solar energy.

              <h2>Resources for Financing Solar</h2>
              <p>
                Securing financing will be a critical component of most solar projects. As the majority of the costs of procuring solar PV are related to upfront installations, financial arrangements are used to allocate these costs across the life of the project. Project financing structures can be complicated, and often require outside lawyers and financiers to complete. The following resources provide an overview of many of these structures as well as tools to help challenge participants understand how their projects could be financed.

              <p>
                Picking the right site for a project can ultimately help decide its success or failure. Community solar developers should carefully screen sites to both minimize potential permitting or interconnection issues, and ensure that project site is capable of producing the requisite amount of electricity to meet the demands of the shared solar offtakers. Developers should also consider alternative siting arrangements (such as brownfield development), and begin to make sure that their project is compliant with all relevant codes and standards. The following resources can help challenge contestants gain a better understanding of these issues including their local permitting and interconnection processes.

                Designing your project to meet the needs of your customers is important for reaching your project goals. Many of the details of the PV design will be solved by the solar developer you choose, however there are several pieces you should consider before hiring an installer. Requests for proposals (RFPs) should clearly state the needs of your project. In addition, it’s recommended to understand PV system basics and refer to these resources before you committing to a contract with an installer.
